## Product

A Product represents a number of Product Items grouped together. Generally there are two ways to use the Product resource:

1. The first way to use the Product resource is to group similar Product Item together. For example if you are selling a T-shirt, you can use Product Item to represent a single size of the T-shirt. If you have 3 different sizes (S, M, L) then you can create three Product Items, but you will only have one Product to group them beacuse to the Customer the three Product Items represents the same Product. When the customer buys the Product they will need to choose which Product Item.

2. The second way to use the Product resource is to group unrelated Product Item together as a bundle or combo. For example if you are selling an apple and an orange together as a fruit combo, you can create two Product Item, one for apple one for orange. You can then use one Product that contains those two Product Items and the Product is the fruit combo you are selling. When the customer buys the Product they are buying all of the corresponding Product Item.

However even if you only have one Product Item you must still use a Product, since a Product Item must belong to a Product.

## Product Collection

A Product Collection represents a collection of Product.

## Product Item

A Product Item represents a single item for sale. An item can be either an Unlockable or a SKU. The Product Item resources are used together with the Product resource to reprepsent items for sale.

`externalFileCollections`           | `Array<ExternalFileCollection>`   |

**Notes**: Exactly one of `sku` and `unlockable` can be set. If one is set, the other must be nil.


## Price

A Price represents a price for a specific Product Item. The Price resource allow you to price your Product Item in many ways:

1. **Fixed Price per Item**: This the most common way to price your item. For example if you are selling a T-shirt for $20 each, you can do the following:

    - set `chargeAmountCents: 2000`; and
    - set `chargeUnit: 'EA'` since you are charging for each T-shirt; and
    - set `orderUnit: 'EA'`, since the customer is ordering by each individual T-shirt.

2. **Variable Price per Item**: This way of pricing is needed when each item can have a different price. For example if you are selling beef at $2/lb and each beef portion is not in the same weight. The weight range for each portion of beef is from 1.5 pounds to 2.5 pounds. In this case you can do the following:

    - set `chargeAmountCents: 200`; and
    - set `estimateAmountCents: 400` since the average weight of each beef portion is 2 pounds, so you can use `2 * 200 = 400` as the estimate to display for your customer so at least they have an idea of how much they will be paying; and
    - set `maximumAmountCents: 500` since the largest portion of beef is $5, you can set that as the maximum so that `authorizedAmountCents` in order will be calculated accordingly to authorize customer's card with the max amount in case they got the largest portion; and
    - set `chargeUnit: 'LB'`, since you are charging by pounds
    - set `orderUnit: 'EA'`, since the customer is ordering each portion of the beef not each pound of beef.

3. **Wholesale Price**: In addition to the above ways of pricing you can also set a wholesale price by setting the `minimumOrderQuantity`. For example if you sell each T-shirt at $20 but wants to cut the price to $15 per T-shirt if a customer buys 10 or more of them at once, then you can create two Price resources for that specified T-shirt Product Item then do the following:

    - set `minimumOrderQuantity: 0` and `chargeAmountCents: 2000` for one of the Price; and
    - set `minimumOrderQuantity: 10` and `chargeAmountCents: 1000` for the other Price.

  When a Customer add the item to their Order, by default FreshCom will use the lowest price with `publicOrderable: true` that matches the `minimumOrderQuantity`.
